#Markdown parser written in Clojure

A markdown parser which compiles to both Clojure and ClojureScript.

**boynton**: Fixed some code block handling to be more consistent with multimarkdown. These are bug fixes for me, YMMV.

***

### Heading

the number of hashes indicates the level of the heading

```
#Heading

##Sub-heading 

###Sub-sub-heading 
```

### Line

```
***

* * *

*****

- - -
```

### Emphasis

```
*foo*
```

### Italics

```
_foo_
```

### Bold

```
**foo**
__foo__
```

### Blockquote
```
>This is a blockquote
with some content

>this is another blockquote
```

### Paragraph

```
This is a paragraph, it's
split into separate lines.

This is another paragraph.

```

### Unordered List

indenting an item makes it into a sublist of the item above it, ordered and unordered lists can be nested within one another

```
* Foo
* Bar
 * Baz
```

```
* foo
* bar

   * baz
     1. foo
     2. bar

   * fuzz

      * blah
      * blue
* brass
```

### Ordered List

```
1. Foo
2. Bar
3. Baz
```

### Inline Code 

```
Here's some code `x + y = z` that's inlined.
```

### Code block

Using three backquotes indicates a start of a code block, the next three backquotes ends the code block section.
Optionally, the language name can be put after the backquotes to produce a tag compatible with the [Syntax Highlighter](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/), eg:

&#96;&#96;&#96;clojure

(defn foo [bar] "baz")

&#96;&#96;&#96;

### Indented Code

indenting by at least 4 spaces creates a code block

    some
    code 
    here

note: XML is escaped in code sections

### Strikethrough

```
~~foo~~
```

### Superscript

```
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
```

### Link
```
[github](http://github.com)
```

### Image
```
![Alt text](http://server/path/to/img.jpg)
![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg "Optional Title")
```
